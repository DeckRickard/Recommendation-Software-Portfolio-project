- Tourist attractions in Istanbul recommendations.

- NICE TO HAVE - ability to search by activity tag, type of place, or location.

- Requires a dataset with each activity having multiple dataypes. use a dictionary. Keys could be 'location', 'tags', 'type'

- NICE TO HAVE - ability to filter down the searched list. E.g: search for a particular locations, then certain tags within that location. This would require the software to create a new, filtered list that could then be searched again.

Program set-up:

1. Welcome the user.

2. Ask the user what category they want to search.

3. Ask the user for their search term. Return all possible results for that category.

4. User chooses a tag from that list by typing a number.

5. The program shows a list of results for that tag.

6. The program asks the user if they want to exit, start a new search, or filter their current list further.

7. Repeat the above steps depending on the user's choice.


Requirements:

- Set up data-structure: provide a separate file containing the data the program will search. Each piece of data will be a dictionary with the key being the name of the attraction and the value being a nested dictionary with values for location, tags (a list or tuple), and type.

- The main program will require two primary methods:
	- A method that handles user input and selection of search queries.
	- A method that conducts the search and returns the searched list (as a new list so that it can be searched again.)

- Secondary methods:
	- A welcome method to print a welcome message.
	- A method to handle if the user wants to continue or exit the program.
